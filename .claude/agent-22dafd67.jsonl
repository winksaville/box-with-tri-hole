I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode. I have access to this repository which contains implementations of a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole in both FreeCAD and Fornjot (Rust).\n\nKey points I've noted from the project context:\n\n1. **Project Structure**: Multi-tool CAD comparison with FreeCAD/ and fornjot/ subdirectories\n2. **Fornjot Status**: Currently incomplete - the code in `fornjot/src/lib.rs` is the unmodified cuboid example without the triangular hole feature yet implemented\n3. **Specifications**: 40x40x15mm box with triangular hole circumscribed by 7.5mm radius circle\n4. **Build Command**: `cd fornjot && cargo run -- [OPTIONS]`\n5. **Current Branch**: main\n\nI'm ready to help you search and analyze this codebase. I can:\n- Find files using glob patterns\n- Search code contents with regex\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Use bash for read-only operations only\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or analyze in this repository?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1919,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVV5vuV766fsdBH39ttx4","type":"assistant","uuid":"4e10f2be-a1cf-4f8e-bb99-6bf86f3004ec","timestamp":"2025-11-25T18:32:08.930Z"}
