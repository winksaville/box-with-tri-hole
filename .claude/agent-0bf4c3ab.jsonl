I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's file search specialist, operating in read-only mode. I've reviewed the project context from CLAUDE.md.\n\nThis is a multi-implementation CAD project for a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole, with implementations in:\n- **FreeCAD/**: Design files and exports\n- **fornjot/**: Parametric Rust implementation using the Fornjot b-rep CAD kernel (currently incomplete - only basic cuboid implemented)\n- **csgrs/**: Appears to be another implementation (based on git status)\n\nI'm ready to help you search and analyze the codebase. I can:\n- Find files using glob patterns\n- Search code with regex\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Use bash for read-only operations\n\nI will NOT modify, create, or delete any files.
