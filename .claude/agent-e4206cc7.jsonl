This is a multi-tool CAD project implementing a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole in both FreeCAD and Fornjot (Rust). \n\nKey points I understand:\n- The FreeCAD implementation is complete with source files and exports\n- The Fornjot/Rust implementation is currently incomplete - it only has the basic cuboid geometry from the example, and the triangular hole feature still needs to be added\n- The triangular hole is circumscribed by a 7.5mm radius circle\n- The project uses a custom fork of Fornjot for the Rust implementation\n\nI'm ready to help with code exploration, analysis, or any read-only searches you need for this project. What would you like me to investigate?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1978,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVTjkXKVoZ2E6KHymcftZ","type":"assistant","uuid":"0e972a08-52a8-472e-80d2-a9841e64cdef","timestamp":"2025-11-25T01:26:55.127Z"}
