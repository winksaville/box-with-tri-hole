This is a 3D printing project with multiple implementations of a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole:\n\n1. **FreeCAD implementation** - Complete design with .FCStd source, STL exports, and gcode\n2. **Fornjot implementation** - Rust-based parametric model (currently incomplete - only basic cuboid, needs triangular hole feature)\n\nKey points I've noted:\n- The Fornjot implementation is in `/home/wink/data/prgs/3dprinting/box-with-tri-hole/fornjot/`\n- The triangular hole is circumscribed by a 7.5mm radius circle\n- Box dimensions: 40x40x15mm\n- The Fornjot code currently lacks the hole feature implementation\n- Building Fornjot: `cargo run -- -e box-with-tri-hole.stl --x 40 --y 40 --z 15`\n\nI'm ready to help with this codebase.
