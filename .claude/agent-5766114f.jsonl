I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm operating in READ-ONLY mode. I have access to this repository which contains implementations of a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole in both FreeCAD and Fornjot (Rust).\n\nKey points I've noted:\n- The Fornjot implementation is incomplete - it currently only has basic cuboid geometry without the triangular hole feature\n- The project is located at `/home/wink/data/prgs/3dprinting/box-with-tri-hole`\n- There are FreeCAD and Fornjot subdirectories\n- The Fornjot uses Fornjot revision 9c51e6f8beba413818753cf7acb2f4810f080167\n- The triangular hole is circumscribed by a 7.5mm radius circle\n\nI'm ready to help you search through and analyze this codebase. What would you like me to find or investigate?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2057,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVPaUkzWetQoHnqfwLChH","type":"assistant","uuid":"0d360e11-f9cb-4194-8cb4-f0958c717fe5","timestamp":"2025-11-22T20:42:57.194Z"}
