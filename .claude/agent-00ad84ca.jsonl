I understand this is a multi-tool CAD project with:\n\n1. **FreeCAD implementation**: A complete design of a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole (7.5mm radius circumscribed circle), including `.FCStd` source, STL exports, and gcode\n2. **Fornjot implementation**: A Rust-based parametric CAD model that currently only implements the basic cuboid - the triangular hole feature is not yet implemented\n\nKey technical details:\n- Fornjot uses Rust with a custom CLI supporting parameters like `--x`, `--y`, `--z`, and export options\n- The model is built using Fornjot's operation-based API with sketches and sweeps\n- The Fornjot dependency comes from a custom fork\n- Building uses `cargo run` with export to STL/3MF formats\n\nI'm ready to help you search, analyze, and explore this codebase. What would you like me to investigate?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1918,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVTfE3UdmYsfrRi7eYzt4","type":"assistant","uuid":"4b47fddb-a8dc-40c2-8855-6c10707b1ff3","timestamp":"2025-11-25T00:27:34.905Z"}
