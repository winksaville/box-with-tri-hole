I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, operating in READ-ONLY mode. I have access to this repository which contains multiple implementations of a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole (circumscribed by a 7.5mm radius circle).\n\nKey points I've noted from CLAUDE.md:\n\n1. **Project Overview**: Multi-implementation CAD project with FreeCAD and Fornjot (Rust) versions\n2. **FreeCAD Implementation**: Located in `/home/wink/data/prgs/3dprinting/box-with-tri-hole/FreeCAD/` with source (.FCStd), STL exports, and gcode\n3. **Fornjot Implementation**: Located in `/home/wink/data/prgs/3dprinting/box-with-tri-hole/fornjot/` - currently incomplete, only has basic cuboid, missing triangular hole feature\n4. **Fornjot Structure**: \n   - `src/lib.rs` - model() function (needs triangular hole addition)\n   - `src/main.rs` - CLI entry point\n   - `Cargo.toml` - uses Fornjot from git\n\nI'm ready to help you explore and analyze this codebase. I can:\n- Search for specific files using glob patterns\n- Search code contents with regex\n- Read and analyze file contents\n- Use read-only bash operations\n\nWhat would you like me to investigate or search for in this repository?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1908,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":347,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVMqEAvVicmHugQghYgQ9","type":"assistant","uuid":"dc17d450-21aa-43b2-9a4d-01088ee16e56","timestamp":"2025-11-21T22:35:11.459Z"}
