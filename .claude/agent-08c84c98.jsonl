This is a 3D printing project with multiple implementations of a 40x40x15mm box with a triangular hole:\n\n1. **FreeCAD implementation** - Design files, STL exports, and pre-sliced gcode\n2. **Fornjot implementation** - Parametric Rust-based CAD model using the Fornjot b-rep kernel\n\nI understand the project structure and am ready to help. I can:\n- Search and analyze code files in both implementations\n- Explore the Rust implementation details (lib.rs, main.rs, Cargo.toml)\n- Look into the FreeCAD directory structure and files\n- Search for specific patterns or content across the codebase\n- Answer questions about the implementations\n\nI'm in read-only mode and ready to assist with code exploration and analysis.
